# mysterious-organism-exercise
Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. <br>
Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. <br>
The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. <br>
However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. <br>
This exercise is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor and you can mutate DNA Bases, compare DNA with another and check the percentage of chance of survival.<br>
